# Lesion Adjuster
Example of GUI developed for my thesis at KU Leuven - _Software for automated detection of ovarian cancer_.

The program is done in Bokeh, which allows the user to modify the segmented lesions and store it.

### Features
  - Inspection of coordinates of true and predicted diameter (the blue and red line)
  - Hide all elements on the figure
  - Drag & drop the predicted diameter of lesion (the blue line)
  - Zoom & modify the predicted lesion (blue polygon)
  - Real-Time update of coordinates, lenght of the diameter and RMSE
  - Export of new coordinates to .csv file
